# ZVerse

The main goal of the project is to render a 3D model of a brick, with realtime editing allowed.
The rendering of the 3D model will be conducted in WebGL, with realtime edits likely being the last implemented structure.
This project will be a deployed ASP.Net web app, hosted using Azure. The webpage will also include database features, including a product listing.
