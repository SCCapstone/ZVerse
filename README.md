# ZVerse

The main goal of the project is to create a website for a company that markets 3D products. One important feature of the website is the rendering of the 3D model of the brick that allows an user to update the model in realtime.  
The rendering of the 3D model will be conducted in WebGL, with the realtime edits likely being the last implemented structure.
This project will be a deployed ASP.Net web app, hosted using Azure. The webpage will also include database features, such as a product catalog.
